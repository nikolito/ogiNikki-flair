## Abstract

There are many ancient documents such as business records and testimonials written before the Edo period in Japan. Machine-readable metadata will be one of effective tools for utilizing those records. In cases of materials related to a very small area, in particular, it is necessary to deal with unique expressions restricted in the area. In this study, we set a speciﬁc goal to generate machine-readable metadata such as Linked Data from the database of the cataloged articles for the Ogi-han Nikki (business records) from the Edo period. We aim to improve the eﬃciency in extraction processes of named entities. For this purpose, we employ two methods. The ﬁrst is eﬀective use of human resources through citizen participation. The second is automated extraction of named entities by machine learning. We show that the proposed method works well even for materials related to a local area.
